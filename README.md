# Voice Assistant for weather information
This Python script utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words into text, the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality, and the requests library to fetch weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to inquire about the weather in a specific city by speaking the city's name.


# Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests
```

# Usage


1. Run the script.
2. The program will prompt you with a greeting and ask for the city whose weather you'd like to know.
3. Speak the name of the desired city.
4. The script will recognize the speech, fetch the weather information for the specified city, and provide the current temperature and weather description.
5. You can exit the application by saying "exit" or "quit."
